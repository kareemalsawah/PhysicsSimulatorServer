# Physics Simulator
A physics simulation web app for the first physics course at Ain Shams University, Faculty of Engineering. It could be used to simulate most of the phenomenon in the course and generate graphs. It also has a board feature that could allows teachers to draw on top of the moving simulations. The web app was hosted on glitch.com
